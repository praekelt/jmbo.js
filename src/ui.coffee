    This function had a race condition problem:

    If you added many views to a navigation controller it's possible to add two
    animations to an element at the same time.

    The `in` animation would complete and remove the `animationEnd` callback, 
    which would inturn remove the callback for the `out` animation.

    So the `out` animation's callback would never fire. I've implemented custom
    events specific to the type of animation. `animationEnd` always fires, and
    triggers a custom event. The custom event can be removed without fear of
    removing any other callbacks.

    className = name + '-' + direction
    customAnimationEvent = 'anim-event-' + className
    $el.addClass className

    # custom event handlers.
    $el.on customAnimationEvent, ->
      $el.off customAnimationEvent
      $el.removeClass className
      if callback then callback()

    # use standard events to fire custom events. This prevents a race condition 
    # if an `in` and `out` event are fired in the same time.
    $el.on 'webkitAnimationEnd animationEnd', (e) ->
      $el.trigger customAnimationEvent
      
    # `animationEnd` callbacks doesn't fire if no animation exists. This is a 
    # bit hacky. Perhaps it would be best to determine if a class exists.
    if name == false
      $el.trigger customAnimationEvent
