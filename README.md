jmbo-apps

JMBO-apps is a JavaScript framework (Argh!) built in CoffeeScript, which requires
Backbone.js + Underscore.js + Zepto.js.

The idea is that jmbo-apps will improve the speed and give you a somewhat flexible
structure to single page apps. By single page we means apps that don't reload.


We currently have the following parts:

- A TitleView (Might subclass ToolbarView.)
    This is a view that only only display a title in a div. This might be 
    expanded later to add toolbar button functionality.

- A View controller:
    Is a backbone model which can contain; a titleView and a childView (The 
    child view is your own custom view.)

- A navigation controller.
    A navigation controller contains a list of view controllers and has a stack.
    You can push and pop views off the stack. The views are animated.



Documentation.

How do you show off and explaint the components of the framework
without coming off as boring?

I honestly don't know.
